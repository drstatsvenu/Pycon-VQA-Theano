# Pycon-VQA-Theano
PyCon Workshop on training VQA models with Theano/Keras

#### Workshop outline :
 + Recap : Basic Neural Networks with Theano
 + Under the hood : Theano optimizations
 + The VQA Problem
 + Compile and train end-to-end networks 
 + Observations and results with VQA
 + Experiments and Visualizations on pre-trained model
 + Introduction to Keras
 + Training own models on MNIST for character recognition

#### Prerequisites :
While most of the topics are introduced in the talk from scratch, familiarity with the following would definitely help :

* Introductory Machine Learning
* Symbolic Algebra ( focus on Symbolic Differentiation )
* Introductory Calculus, Linear Algebra
* Containers in Python
* Convolution Neural Networks ~ Recurrent Neural Networks

##### **For hands-on** :
* Installed [Theano](https://github.com/Theano/Theano), [Keras](http://keras.io), [iPython](https://ipython.org/install.html)
